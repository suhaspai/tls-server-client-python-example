# tls-server-client-python-example
The code and the explanation for this example was generated using Google's Gemini chatbot.
It uses ssl library to establish a secure TLS connection between server and client. 
Typing "make" will run the default target that creates keys and certificates and runs
the example.

Explanation:
* Import necessary libraries:
* socket: For creating and managing TCP/IP sockets.
* ssl: For enabling TLS/SSL encryption.
* 
Server-side:
* socket.socket(): Creates a TCP/IP socket.
* ssl.create_default_context(): Creates an SSL context with default settings.
* context.wrap_socket(): Wraps the socket with TLS/SSL encryption.
* ssock.bind(): Binds the socket to the specified address and port.
* ssock.listen(): Starts listening for incoming connections.
* ssock.accept(): Accepts a connection from a client.
* conn.recv()/conn.sendall(): Receives and sends data over the secure connection.
* 
Client-side:
* socket.socket(): Creates a TCP/IP socket.
* ssl.create_default_context(): Creates an SSL context with default settings.
* context.wrap_socket(): Wraps the socket with TLS/SSL encryption.
* ssock.connect(): Connects to the server.
* ssock.sendall()/ssock.recv(): Sends and receives data over the secure connection.
* 
Key points:
* This example demonstrates basic TLS communication over TCP/IP.
* Ensure that both the server and client have the necessary certificates and keys configured for secure communication.
* You can modify the SSL context to customize security settings (e.g., cipher suites, certificate verification).
* This is a simplified example, and real-world applications may require more complex handling of connections, data, and security.
Note: This code assumes that both the server and client are running on the same machine. For communication between different machines, you'll need to adjust the HOST values accordingly.
This example provides a basic foundation for implementing TLS communication in Python. You can further customize it based on your specific requirements and security needs.
